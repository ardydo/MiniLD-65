# Youth

### An update
At first this was something for miniLD 65 that I have no idea of what it was going to be a game for mini ludum dare 65. It would be my third game for the one game a month thingie... But things didn't go as planned.

The month was though enough as it is. Things weren't going as I expected, but I was sure I would be able to finish the game and publish it and stuff... Turns out life had something else planned and that was completely fucking up with any semblance of stability I had... The details doesn't matter, but... if you take a look on my github contributions you'll see that... Something sunddenly stopped working by the end of February.

Things kinda did get better. I mean... Yeah.

I was left with this idea of a game that I really wanted to implement and make. I tried to work on it for March but, guess what? I just wasn't able to (but I finished reading all of boku no hero academia and got to course certificates and learned a fuckton of programming basics that I had never even tried looking into). I just didn't aply myself enough to do it.

Now that things are somewhat functioning (and I don't have to worry... too much... about not being homeless) and I started planning this month more throughly I want to restart my monthly game chain and even though there is a Ludum Dare and I could just use it I still catch myself drifting towards this idea that I had for this game... So this month will have two games and fuck it.

### What the actual fuck you're talking about I thought this was a repo and not a fucking blog

It's mine and I do whatever the fuck I want with it. Though I'll prolly just remove it later.

## The game

Youth is kinda a Space Invanders clone.

Enemies come from the top and try to murder you, while you try to just survive. It gets harder with time, since not only enemies get stronger but there also comes in bigger waves. As you destroy then, you gain important experience points that's unique for each tipe of enemy. They upgrade your shots power against that expecific kind of enemy while also providing some neato upgrades!

Sounds complicated! But don't worry! Motherbase is here! It will shoot enemies you weren't meant to be shooting anyway while you focus on the oh so important FOCUS targets! Why they're important? Because Motherbase said so and everybody knows that Motherbase knows best! So just follow it and shoot the FOCUS targets and everything is going to be a-okay!

;D
