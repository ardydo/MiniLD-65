youth
    concept
        you control a ship
            moving sideways
            shooting
        enemies spawns
            they shoot too
            they get stronger with time
            they get more numerous
            as you kill then, you get more powerfull against then
        motherbase protects you
            it shoots rockets at then
            the rockets are not as fast as bullets
            they never miss, tho
        objective
            survive
        progression
            motherbase is taking care of you (youth)
                on the first stages, mothership is with you, during your training
                it decides what kind of enemy will show up and what your're supossed to shoot
                it takes care of the rest of enemies
            motherbase leaves ("adulthood")
                after you're "strong enough" motherbase leaves you for good
            inevitable death (oh hey, what was you expecting?)
                now that you have to handle all kinds of enemies by yourself and they're stronger, they'll simply overwhelm you.
                I must make sure that by this point, you can't really compete with the enemies and fail
        arcade
            after beating the actual "story mode" you unlock arcade mode
                no motherbase but you face off against the enemies when they're weak
                it gets harder with time. you earn points for killing enemies
                just try to get a highscore

        background
            some stars or space or something like that, I guess
    code
        upgrade system
            non linear increas
                make it a that other kind of progression thingie,   geometrical? I can't have it always leveling up on the same number or I can't increase dificulty by adding more enemies
            
            display how many enemies are needed to hit the upgrade
                maybe, when it does level up, I can calculate the number of enemies needed (first upgrade requirement * level or something similar) and then instead of adding to a global var everytime an enemy dies, I can just subtract one. Then when it reachs 0, I trigger an upgrade and recalculate it and be happy. So I'll actually do this
            
            display the level too

        mother base
            floaty
                needs to float up and down, just silly
            shooting
                targeting system
                    needs to evaluate every enemy and decide the ones to shoot 
                        it compares the enemy type and if it meets the criteria, adds it to an array
                        if it meets and to another if it doesn't
                        ignores enemies already processed

                    needs to not shoot the same target twice
                        after it shoots it needs to add the enemy to a list and not shoot at it
                        the list needs to be purged whenever an enemy dies, as to not consume all the fucing memory
            emergency protocol
                when you're in too much danger, it will do something to protect the player
                    bullet elimination protocol
                        destroy all enemy bullets
                    proximity protocol
                        when the enemy get's too close, shoots at all of then at once
